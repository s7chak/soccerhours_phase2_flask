Soccer Hours
An Event hosting platform for Soccerheads!


A website for soccer players who want to book events and allow other users to join their events.
Signed up users can search events by zip code, or by entering date and slot timings.

They can then join any game in their preferred location and time if there is a game scheduled at that date and time, or host their own event.

Admin users have extra access to removing events, removing users, activating users, or making users administrators.
